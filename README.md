# confidence_levels_framework

This framework incorporates the confidence levels in pairwise comparisons, in order to deal with uncertainty issues related to the individual expert judgments.
A theoretical model based on the multivariate normal cumulative distribution function is used to estimate the probability of rank reversal (PRR).

The basic idea behind our approach is simple: each expert is asked to quantify his confidence level on a particular judgment or a set of judgments, in terms of a number
in the range of 0 to 100%. We then apply a methodological framework that translates the individual confidence levels to a measure on the credibility of the outcome and
more specifically we estimate the probability PRR that the ranking of at least two alternatives is reversed.
